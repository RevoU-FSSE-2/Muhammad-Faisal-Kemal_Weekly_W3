# RevoU FSSE Intermediate Assignment Week 03

This is my third assignment at RevoU full stack software engineering program. The project site created using css responsive design, css flexbox and html form.


This week have several skill sets:

- Applying custom font using @font-face
- Applying text-shadow to text
- Applying 1 responsive background image, (using contain or cover, suit your
needs)
- Applying 1responsive image with picture + source + srcset method
- Creating one Asymmetrical Grid
- Using at least one advanced form element (date, color, local date, range
picker) and make sure it has correct form attributes as you desired (example: you
wish your form requires at least a full name before submit, then you need to add a
correct form attribute for that).
- Creating simple animation with two methods: animation and transition
